- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jamster3000
- 👀 I’m passionate about programming and eager to learn new languages. I'm currently a college student with a work placement but still find little bits of time to work on my own programming projects too.
- 🌿 I have currently mastered python and starting to delve into c# and the basics of javascript.
- 🍂 I am very interested in machine learning as it seems so easy to set up the basics, just wish the data collection would be faster.
- 🌱 I've dabbles with c++ a bit in the past but might be working on learning that more in the future.
- I'm a dungeons and dragons fan so I have put myself out there in the Cauldron-vtt community for dnd specifically, including a website full of guidance on hoe to use every feature of Cauldron and a web browser extension.
