- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jamster3000
- 👀 I’m passionate about programming and eager to learn new languages. I'm currently a college student with a work placement but still find little bits of time to work on my own programming projects too.
- 🌿 I’m currently mastering python and starting to delve into c# and the basics of javascript. 
- 🌱 I've dabbles with c++ a bit in the past but might be working on learning that more in the future.
